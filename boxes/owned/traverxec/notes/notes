We could not view the contents of david's directory but knew that files existed there
So we can still cd up a level to /home/david/public_www/protected_files_area/

Found a compressed .tgz file containing ssh keys
	- base64 copy and pasted it to my directory
	- md5sum to check the validity 

untared it and recived a directory /home/david/.ssh with 3 files in it
	- authorized_keys
	- id_rsa
	- id_rsa.pub

	where id_rsa is the private key which we DO NOT have the password for... We do.. it just doesnt work when trying to ssh as user david..
	and we have found a public key

---------
Like Postman we will use ssh2john to put put the file in the correct brute force format for john to read. 

	python ssh2john.py  id_rsa > id_rsa_ssh2johned

and then we brute force it
	
	john --wordlist-/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_rsa_ssh2johned
