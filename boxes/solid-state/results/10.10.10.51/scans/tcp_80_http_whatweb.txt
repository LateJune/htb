[ Apache ]
	The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and 
	maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating 
	systems including UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this 
	project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible 
	server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current 
	HTTP standards. 

	Version      : 2.4.25 (from HTTP Server Header)
	Google Dorks: (3)
	Website     : http://httpd.apache.org/

[ Email ]
	Extract email addresses. Find valid email address and 
	syntactically invalid email addresses from mailto: link 
	tags. We match syntactically invalid links containing 
	mailto: to catch anti-spam email addresses, eg. bob at 
	gmail.com. This uses the simplified email regular 
	expression from 
	http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html for valid 
	email address matching.
